# Second Fetch

In this chapter, you are going to request an image of a cat from the URL provided below, and then update the `src` attribute of the image element once you get the data back.

```txt
http://shibe.online/api/cats?count=1&urls=true&httpsUrls=false
```

Watch a video on how the response data is slightly different from the previous chapter and update the DOM correctly.
