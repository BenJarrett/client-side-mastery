# Composing Dynamic HTML

Stay in your `main.js` module and now you're going to build the new HTML that you want to be in the `<main>` HTML element.

## Intro to InnerHTML

The goals is to take a single HTML string that contains the 2 smaller chunks of HTML generated by **HeroList** and **VillainList** and dynamically update the DOM with it.

It will replace the existing `<h1>The Dynamite Duo</h1>` that you manually typed in earlier in the project.

This is accomplished by using the `.innerHTML` property of any HTML element.

You can watch a brief video that shows how the `.innerHTML` and `.textContent` properties of HTML elements work.

## Dynamic HTML

Place the following code in the main module.

```js
// Import the function references that generate the HTML lists
import { HeroList } from "./heroes.js"
import { VillainList } from "./villains.js"

// Capture the return values of the HTML list generators
const heroListHTML = HeroList()
const villainListHTML = VillainList()

// Build up a single string containing both chunks of HTML
const theWholeEnchilada = `
    <h1>Heroes</h1>
    ${heroListHTML}

    <h1>Villains</h1>
    ${villainListHTML}
`

/*
    This is the code you wrote in the last chapter to get a
    reference to the <main> element
*/
const theExistingMainElement = document.querySelector("#container")

// Take the whole HTML string and update the innerHTML of the <main> element
theExistingMainElement.innerHTML = theWholeEnchilada
```

Refresh your browser and you will see the new, dynamically created HTML gets injected into the DOM.
