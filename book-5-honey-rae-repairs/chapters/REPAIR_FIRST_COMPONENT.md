### Vocabulary Terms
> **React Components:**  Independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

> **JSX:** A syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.

> **React Hooks:** Functions from the React library (they start with "use") that let you “hook into” state and lifecycle features. 

> **useState:** A React Hook that allows you to add state to a component. It accepts one argument, the initial value for the state, and returns an array. The returned array contains the state value at index 0 and a function that modifies the state at index 1.
