# Displaying All The Posts
In this chapter you will implement the following user stories for the ***All Posts*** view:

**Given** the user wishes to view a list of all the posts<br>
**When** the user is at the home route or visits the All Posts view<br>
**Then** the ***title***, ***topic*** and ***number of likes*** will display for each post in the database. 

**Given** the user wishes to filter the posts by topic<br>
**When** the user clicks on the topic dropdown<br>
**And** chooses a topic<br>
**Then** only the posts about the selected topic will display

**Given** the user wishes to search for a post<br>
**When** the user enters a search term in the search input field<br>
**Then** only the posts with a title that contains the search term will display

## Getting started
Begin by creating a new component for `AllPosts`. A `components` and `services` directory have been provided for you. The rest of your file structure is up to you. The first user story mentions the `home route`. Don't worry about this for now, we'll introduce routes in Part 3 of this book. For the time being, render your `AllPosts` component in the `App` component, the same we have done with `CustomerList` and `EmployeeList` in Honey Rae Repairs. 


The layout and theme is entirely up to you! Go all out, or keep it simple. Just make it clean and tidy (_hello flexbox!_)
