# Capstone Information

## Proposal Documents
The capstone proposal is a conversation with your assigned instructor.  The sections highlighted below make sure you have thought through all aspects of the project. Your instructor will help you flush out any potential problems and make sure the project is scoped appropriately for a 3 week timeline.  

Be prepared for this document to change after meeting with your instructor.  You may need to meet more than once with your instructor.  This is a normal part of the planning process.

**Your instructor must approve your proposal BEFORE you start coding.**

Your proposal should include the following sections:
- Title
- Description
- ERD
- Features
- Wireframe(s)

 
### Title
A basic working title is fine.  It can change, so don't stress about this.

### Description
This should be a paragraph that includes the problem the app solves and why you are passionate about creating it.

### ERD
The ERD can be a link or an image.  It should include all the data you will need.

### Features
This should be a list with a brief description of each feature you want to implement.  Indicate whether each feature is part of the MVP or a stretch goal. 

### Wireframe
Your wireframe can be created by hand or through software.  Share a link, screenshot or picture with your instructor.  

## Requirements
- Use React
- No Games or Calendars
- If you are going to use a 3rd party API, you must show an instructor you can access the data.

## To think about

- Don't dream too big.  Make sure you can complete the project in 3 weeks.
- Keep it simple. It does not need to be ground break.  Don't be afraid to do something that's already been done.
- What problem are you solving/why do you want to make this?
- You will be presenting this to potential employers.  Keep the content professional and not controversial.
