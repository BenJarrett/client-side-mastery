# Tour Some Sugar On Me

You have been hired by Samantha Ducarte, a tour promoter, to build a website that allows her to see the venues that she manages, a list of all bands that will be performing for the next 6 months, and a list of all bookings.

## Venues

Each venue can accomodate 2 bands per night as Samantha only works with smaller places. You need to record the name of the venue, its address, square footage, and maximum occupancy.

## Bands

The bands that Samantha helps book venues are all young and hungry. This means that they can perform 1 or 2 acts every day. You must record the band name, number of members, musical genre, and the year they formed as a band.

## Bookings

Samantha also wants to see a list at the bottom of the page that shows which band(s) are playing at each venue every night. She wants the band name, the venue name, and the date of the booking.

##### Example

"Rocket Pumpkins are playing at The Cellar Moss on 12/13/2023"

## Layout

The layout is going to be the same as DeShawn's and Brewed Awakenings. The list of the individual resources at the top of the screen, and the bookings at the bottom.
